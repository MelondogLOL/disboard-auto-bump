**This Chrome Extension simply auto-bumps your Discord server on Disboard. Useful for easily gaining more discord members in your server!**

# Install Instructions

Until I decide to pay the dev licence fee, this will be the way to install the extension.

1. Visit `chrome://extensions/` (copy this into the search bar) and enable Developer mode.

3. Drag and drop the folder into `chrome://extensions/`.

# FAQ

**Q: Why does the tab keep automatically unloading?**

A: Some browsers automatically unload tabs and also some browser extensions (such as "The Great Suspender") may unload them. Make sure to pin the tab and if it still occurs, all you need to do is to go onto `chrome://discards/`, go onto the "Discards" tab, and toggle "Auto Discardable" on `Dashboard | DISBOARD: Discord Server List`. Hope this helps!

**Q: Why doesn't the timer correspond with the time left to bump?**

A: This is to avoid being delisted of Disboard and is normal. It can be disabled by switching off Safety Mode in the extension popup.

**Q: IT STILL DOESN'T WORK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!???**
