# Install Instructions

Until I decide to pay the dev licence fee, this will be the way to install the extension.

1. Visit `chrome://extensions/` (copy this into the search bar) and enable Developer mode.

# FAQ

**Q: Why does the tab keep automatically unloading?**

A: Some browsers automatically unload tabs and also some browser extensions (such as "The Great Suspender") may unload them. Make sure to pin the tab and if it still occurs, all you need to do is to go onto `chrome://discards/`, go onto the "Discards" tab, and toggle "Auto Discardable" on `Dashboard | DISBOARD: Discord Server List`. Hope this helps!

**Q: Why doesn't the timer correspond with the time left to bump?**

A: This is to avoid being delisted of Disboard and is normal. It can be disabled by switching off Safety Mode in the extension popup.

**Q: Why do I get a message telling me that this is unsafe?**

A: The warning "Disable developer mode extensions" is displayed in Chrome when you install non Chrome Web Store extensions in the browser. Read more and learn how to disable it [here](https://www.ghacks.net/2017/07/04/hide-chromes-disable-developer-mode-extensions-warning/). If you would like to continue using the extension then simply press 'Cancel' when you see this message.
